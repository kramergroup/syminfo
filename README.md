# syminfo
Utility for symmetry information of crystal structures

'syminfo' is a command-line utility to obtain symmetry information from crystal structures. Specifically, 'syminfo' can do the following:

- Find all space group operations
- Find symmetry equivalent atoms in the unit cell

*Warning*: This code is largely untested. Determination of symmetry operations is believed to be reliable. Other functionality should be thoroughly tested!
